### Compare Care Central California

Compare care was created as part of a 24 hour hackathon with the goal of making publically available health data more accessible. It's not in active development, but can be accessed here http://comparecare.hypexr.org/

#### Compare Care's Mission

We created CompareCare to help people in the valley find hospitals based on infection and mortality rates. It is difficult to obtain these elements in one place, and the data available can be very confusing and overwhelming.

CompareCare allows users to choose a hospital based on an set of simple options. People don't have to sort through complicated information to get a good result. As the user completes the CompareCare wizard, hospital results are narrowed down to match the best hospital in their local area.
